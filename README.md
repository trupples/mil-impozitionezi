## mil-impozitionezi

Basic saddle-stitch impositioning that just works(TM)

Feature(s):
- Imposition bleed-less A x B pages into A x 2B signatures

TODO:
- Imposition pages with bleed (A+t+b x B+l+r) into A+t+b x 2B+l+r signatures, cutting out middle bleed

Motivation: The [TUCN](https://utcluj.ro) typography refuses to imposition booklets and demand that clients do the impositioning themselves. This, of course, is a #%!& show and has given both me and fellow students many headaches.
